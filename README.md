# WifiSpy for Android #

WifiSpy is a more modern approach at using the Android platform to observe wireless networks and provides a means to visualize and share recorded data.

## Other Android Projects ##

For another more functional (albeit with a much older UI) Android tool for recording and mapping wireless networks, check out [wiglewifi](https://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving) which also makes use of the vast amount of wireless network information available from [Wigle.net](https://wigle.net).

## Current Status ##

Still in the early development phase, this project isn't yet functional. Please feel free to contact me if you wish to participate in the development, have any ideas or discover any bugs. _(Jon Hannah 2012/11/11)_
